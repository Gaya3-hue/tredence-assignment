# Workflow Engine - Basic Draft (Assignment Attempt)

This is a partial attempt for the Tredence AI Engineering assignment.
I focused mainly on setting up the folder structure and basic idea,
but did not complete the full engine execution.

## What is included
- Basic files: engine.py, workflows.py, main.py
- A simple outline of how nodes and edges would be arranged
- FastAPI endpoints that return placeholder values

## What is NOT implemented
- Actual workflow execution
- Looping and conditional routing logic
- Persistent state or graph storage
- Detailed error handling

## Notes
Due to time limits, I could not complete the full workflow engine,
but I submitted the basic structure to show understanding of the approach.
